            <h2>What to Wear</h2>
            <p>Black white and tartan are traditional but not required. Most folks dress up for the event, and we encourage you to dress up at least a little. Being the guy in the hoodie may be fine for you, but it takes away from others' experience. But hey, we're not going to kick you out no matter what you wear. But you do have to wear something. No nudes.</p>
